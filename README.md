Udacity Neighborhood Map Project

This page was setup for the Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree Neighborhood Map project.

It utilizes KnockoutJS, jQuery, Google Maps API, and Yelp API.

If you don't have a server program setup on your computer to serve the page, you can utilize Python's HTTP server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` ran from the directory where you have this project code.  Or you can just load the `index.html` file in a browser.

The map displays some great restaurants and bars in the Desert Ridge area of Phoenix, AZ and their related Yelp ratings and links.
